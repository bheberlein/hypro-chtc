## Form Responses

- *UW-Madison Faculty Sponsor (PI)*

  >  **Phil Townsend ptownsend@wisc.edu**

- *Do you expect someone to mentor you on how to use CHTC resources?*

  >  **Yes**

- *About Your Mentor*

  >  **Brendan Heberlein bheberlein@wisc.edu**

- *How did you hear about CHTC? (Check all that apply)*

  >  **Word of Mouth from *inside* your Research Group (PI, group member, etc.)**

- *Briefly describe your research to help us answer the question, "How can CHTC help your research?"*

  > **CHTC has been instrumental in scaling up the Townsend Lab's airborne imaging program by enabling high-throughput processing of large image datasets. Our data collection flights generate large image datasets which require intensive processing to prepare them for analysis.**


- *Which of the following could be used to describe your research computing? (Check all that apply)*

  > - [x] **Data analysis**
  > - [x] **Simulation/Modeling**
  > - [x] Other: **Image processing**

- *What is the primary software/program/package(s) that you plan on using? If possible, provide a link to the program's website.*

  > **Python code developed by Townsend Lab: https://github.com/EnSpec/hypro, https://github.com/EnSpec/hytools**

- *Which of the following systems have you used for similar computing work? (Check all that apply)*

  > Respond based on your personal experience

- *Based on the above explanation, which system best fits your computing needs?*

  > **High Throughput Computing (HTC)**

- *How many CPU cores does one calculation need? (Modern computers typically have 4-8+ CPU cores per machine.)*

  > **< 8**

- *How much memory/RAM (in GB) does one calculation need? (Modern computers typically have 4-16 GB per machine.)*

  > **32 - 80**

- *How much disk space (in GB) does one calculation need? Include the size of the input and output data, as well as any programs or scripts, if possible.*

  > **80 - 100**

- *How long (in hours) does your calculation take to run using the resources you selected above?* 

  > **< 8**

- *Does your calculation need GPU(s)?*

  > **No, my calculation does not need a GPU**

- *How many calculations like the one you've described above do you want to run?*

  > **On the order of 1000 - 2000 images per year.**

- *Please provide any additional information that would aid us in creating your account.*

  > **Please add to `townsend_user` group. Will need access to `townsend-ap` & our `townsend_airborne` allocation on Staging.**
